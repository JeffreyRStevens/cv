Please find my official CV at https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/cv or view my [PDF version](https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/cv/cv.pdf).

My CV is based on the [template from Ben Moore](https://github.com/blmoore/md-cv). I have altered the `cv-print.css` file and written a shell script (`make_pdf.sh`) to remove the YAML header from the CV and adjust the margins when using `pandoc` to produce the PDF.
